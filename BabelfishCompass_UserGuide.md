# What Is Babelfish Compass?

The Babelfish Compass (short for "**COMP**atibility **ASS**essment") tool analyzes SQL/DDL code for one or more Microsoft SQL Server databases to identify the SQL features which are not compatible with **Babelfish for PostgreSQL**.

Users of SQL Server can use Babelfish Compass to analyze the SQL/DDL code for their current SQL Server-based applications for compatibility with Babelfish. The purpose of such analysis is to inform a Go/No Go decision about whether it makes sense -or not- to consider starting a migration project from SQL Server to Babelfish. For this purpose, Babelfish Compass produces an assessment report which lists -in great detail- all SQL features found in the SQL/DDL code, and whether or not these are supported by the latest version of Babelfish.

A new version of Babelfish Compass will be available as part of every Babelfish release containing new or changed functionality.

Note that Babelfish Compass is a stand-alone, on-premises tool. While Babelfish Compass is part of the Babelfish product, it is technically separate from Babelfish itself as well as from the Babelfish code, and is located in a separate GitHub repository.

# Installing Babelfish Compass

## Requirements

Before installing Babelfish Compass, the following are required:
- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run Babelfish Compass. The Java JRE version must be 8 or higher (64-bit version).
- Babelfish Compass produces compatibility assessment reports in HTML format. For viewing the HTML output, it is recommended to use a recent release of the Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browsers.
- On Mac/Linux (currently in beta), you need to be able to run a **bash** script (e.g. with `#!/bin/bash`).

## Downloading Babelfish Compass

Babelfish Compass is available as open-source at [https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_compass](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_compass)

A binary version can be downloaded from here: [https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_compass/releases/latest](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_compass/releases/latest) ; pick the most recent **BabelfishCompass_**\<version\>**.zip** file.

The installation instructions below are based on this download.

## Installation

Babelfish Compass is distributed as an "executable JAR", which requires no `CLASSPATH` settings. The only environmental requirement is that the Java JRE is in the `PATH`.

Installation steps on Windows:
1. Download the **BabelfishCompass.zip** file (see previous section)
2. Unzip this file so that the contents are placed in an installation directory of choice; the rest of this document will assume **C:\BabelfishCompass**
3. In case a previous installation is already present in your installation directory, you can overwrite this (but it is recommended to make a backup copy first)
4. Installation is complete

Installation steps on Mac/Linux (currently in beta):
1. Download the **BabelfishCompass.zip** file (see previous section)
2. Unzip this file so that the contents are placed in an installation directory of choice; the rest of this document will assume **/opt/BabelfishCompass**
3. In case a previous installation is already present in your installation directory, you can overwrite this (but it is recommended to make a backup copy first)
4. Verify the shell script **BabelfishCompass.sh** is executable by running `./BabelfishCompass.sh` If not, run: `chmod +x BabelfishCompass.sh`
5. Installation is complete

<br/>

# Running Babelfish Compass (Windows)

On Windows, Babelfish Compass is invoked by opening a `cmd` command prompt (a.k.a. "DOS box") in the directory where Babelfish Compass is installed. By default, this is located at **C:\BabelfishCompass**.

At the command prompt, run `BabelfishCompass` (or `BabelfishCompass.bat`) with various additional command-line options as needed (see further in this document).

To see online help information on the various command options, specify `-help`:

`C:\BabelfishCompass> BabelfishCompass -help`

Babelfish Compass usage typically starts with command-line execution to create an assessment report file. The assessment report output file provides a detailed summary of the supported and unsupported SQL features in Babelfish for the analyzed SQL Server script(s).

In the simplest, and likely most common case, a single SQL/DDL script is analyzed. This requires specifying a report name and an input file, for example:

`C:\BabelfishCompass> BabelfishCompass MyFirstReport C:\temp\AnyCompany.sql`

This creates an assessment report named **MyFirstReport**, containing the analysis for SQL/DDL script **AnyCompany.sql**.

When the report is created, BabelfishCompass will automatically:
1. Open an explorer window in the directory where the report files are stored
2. Open the generated assessment report in the default browser

The full pathname of the report file is also printed to `stdout`.

Many additional command-line options can be used, such as processing multiple input scripts (for one application or multiple applications), generating more detailed output reports. See below for details.

<br/>

# Running Babelfish Compass (Mac/Linux)

On Mac/Linux (currently in beta), Babelfish Compass is invoked by opening a **bash** command prompt session in the directory where Babelfish Compass is installed. At the bash command prompt, run `BabelfishCompass.sh`:
`$ ./BabelfishCompass.sh -help`

The automatic opening of the generated report in the browser, as on Windows, may not currently work on Mac/Linux. In this case, the user should explicitly open the generated report in a browser themselves.

Otherwise, Babelfish Compass is operated as on Windows. For further details, please see the rest of this User Guide, which assumes a Windows environment.

<br/>

# Reports, applications & input files

The Babelfish Compass tool is based on the concept of a report â€“ the user must specify a report name which can be chosen freely. A report is the result of analyzing one or more SQL/DDL scripts. In the simplest case, a single SQL/DDL script is analyzed. Multiple input scripts are also possible.

Each input script is associated with an application name. By default, the application name is taken from the input script file name, e.g. a script named **Account.sql** is assumed to be for application **Accounts**. However, the application name can also be explicitly specified with the `-appname` flag. A report can cover multiple input scripts for the same application, as well as multiple scripts for different applications. Examples:

-- single input file for application **Accounts**:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\Accounts.sql`

-- single input file for application **Sales**:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\ddl.20210913.sql -appname Sales`

-- multiple input files for application **Sales**:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\ddl.20210913*.sql -appname Sales`

-- multiple input files for applications **Accounts**, **Sales** and **HR**:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\Accounts.sql C:\temp\Sales.sql C:\temp\HR.sql`

When a report is created for multiple applications, the assessment report can optionally indicate which applications contribute to a particular line item. To indicate this, use `-reportoption apps`.

The report will contain lines like the following. This means 45 cases of the SOUNDEX() built-in function were found, in three applications as indicated:

`SOUNDEX(): 45 #apps=3: Accounts(16), Support(20), HR(9)`

<br/>

# Specifying the Babelfish version

By default, Babelfish Compass delivers a compatibility assessment for the most recent version of Babelfish, as indicated in the **BabelfishFeatures.cfg** file. It is possible to perform the assessment for an earlier version of Babelfish by specifying the older version, e.g. `-babelfish-version 1.0.3`

The initial GA version of Babelfish is version 1.0.0. Since no older version exists at the time of the initial release, this option will only be available with later Babelfish releases.

<br/>

# Command-line options
To display all command-line options, run `BabelfishCompass -help`. All command-line options are optional.

- `-version`: displays the version of the Babelfish Compass tool
- `-explain`: displays some high-level guidance on how to use the Babelfish Compass tool
- `-encoding <encoding>`: specifies the encoding of the input files, in case these are not ASCII or the default encoding (this default is shown by -help).<br/></br>
When specifying `-encoding`, this encoding is applied to all input files. To process multiple input files with different encodings, import these separately (with `-add`) with the correct encoding for each input file.<br/></br>
Unicode-formatted files with BOM bits are automatically detected and processed accordingly,
so `-encoding` does not need to be specified.<br/></br>
To see the supported encodings, run `-encoding help`
- `-babelfish-version <version>`: performs analysis for an older BBF version. See section 'Specifying the Babelfish version'
- `-add`: import an additional SQL/DDL script to an existing report; perform analysis and generate a report
- `-replace`: replace an already-imported SQL/DDL script in an existing report; perform analysis and generate a report
- `-delete`: for an already existing report, delete all files first before recreating it
- `-noreport`: perform analysis, but do not generate a report. This can be useful when multiple files are imported; without `-noreport`, a report would be generated after every imported file. To generate a report after importing all files, use `-reportonly`.
- `-reportfile`: specifies the filename for the report. This does not affect the directory where the report files are located. See the examples below.
- `-importonly`: import the SQL/DDL script, but do not perform analysis or generate a report. This can be useful when importing multiple files, as the analysis would otherwise be performed after every imported file.
- `analyze`: performs analysis on imported files, and generates a report. This can be used after importing files with `-importonly`, or to re-run analysis on imported files in an earlier report (for example, when re-running the analysis when a later version of Babelfish has become available)
- `-list`: displays the files/applications that have been imported for a report
- `-reportonly`: generate a report for already-imported and analyzed SQL/DDL scripts. The report name should be specified, and no input files can be specified. This option is useful to generate additional detailed assessment reports, for example with a cross-reference or additional filtering (see `-reportoption`).
- `-reportoption <options>`: specifies options for generating the final assessment report. Different options can be specified in a comma-separated list (without spaces), and/or by using multiple `-reportoption` flags. The cross-reference is not generated by default, as this potentially makes the assessment report very long.<br/><br/>
Possible options are:
    - `xref` or `xref=all`: generates two cross-references for all items that are marked as "not supported" or "review". One cross-reference is ordered by SQL feature, the other by objects for which such items were detected.
    - `xref=feature` or `xref=object`: generates only the cross-reference by feature, or by object, respectively.
    - `status=<status>`: with `xref`, specifies the categories for which the cross-reference should be generated. Without this option, a cross-reference is generated only for items marked as "not supported" or "review". To generate a cross-reference for a different category, specify (for example) `status=supported` or `status=ignored`. With `status=all`, a cross-reference for all items is generated. _Note that using this option can result in a longer assessment report._
    - `detail`: with `xref`, generates additional detail for a reported item. For example, when reporting an object which cannot be created, specifying detail will include the name of the object. _The report may get significantly longer as a result._
    - `filter=<string>`: with `xref`, only include items which match the specified string(case- insensitive). This can be useful when the generated cross-reference is very long, for example to cross-reference only specific items of interest. Note that the Summary section is not affected by this option.
    - `linenrs=<number>`: with `xref`, define the maximum number of line numbers mentioned in the cross-reference before suppressing the rest and adding "_+NNN_ more". By default, the maximum number is 10.
    - `notabs`: with `xref`, the hyperlinks to the original SQL source code will open in the same browser window instead of in a new tab. By default, a hyperlink opens in a new tab. Note: For large SQL source files, it may take some time before the browser displays the desired line. If this takes too long, it is also possible to manually access the corresponding flat text file (same filename, but with a `.dat` suffix instead of `.html`).
    - `apps`: when a report covers multiple applications, this option will show the which applications contribute to a particular line item in the Summary section. For example, the following means that 45 cases of the `SOUNDEX()` built-in function were found, in three applications as indicated:\
    `SOUNDEX(): 45 #apps=3: Accounts(16), Support(20), HR(9)`
    - `batchnr`: with `xref`, displays the location of an item as a combination of the batch number in the file, the starting line number of the batch in the source file, and the line number in the batch. By default, the location is shown as the line number in the source file.
- `-quotedid {on|off}`: sets `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` at the start of each SQL/DDL script. Default = ON
- `-pgimport "pg-connection-attributes"`: Creates a database table `BBFCompass` in a PostgreSQL database, and loads all captured items into the table. This table can then be accessed with SQL queries to determine additional details (example: find all SQL functions with at least two parameters, a `MONEY` result type, and a table variable operation in the function body).<br/><br/>
The PostgreSQL connection attributes are specified as a comma-separated list as follows: `host,port,username,password,dbname`. The import is performed through a script created in the captured subdirectory. The `psql` utility must be installed and in the `PATH`.
Note that the password is not saved anywhere and not written to any file (also not to temporary files).
- `-pgimportappend`: with `-pgimport`, appends to an already-existing PostgreSQL table. Without this option, `-pgimport` will drop the table if it exists, before recreating it.

<br/>

# Examples

Generate a default report without cross-reference for application Sales:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\Sales.sql`

Generate a default report without cross-reference for application Sales, deleting the report first if it already existed:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport C:\temp\Sales.sql -delete`

Generate a report for applications Accounts and Sales, with a cross-reference for all categories, including additional detail, and allowing up to 100 line numbers to be enumerated in the cross-reference:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport2 C:\temp\account*.sql -appname Accounts -add -noreport`\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport2 C:\temp\sales.sql -add -noreport`\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport2 -reportoptions xref,status=all,detail,linenrs=100`

Display all files/applications imported for MyReport2:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport2 -list`

Re-run analysis for an existing report, but specifically for Babelfish version 1.3.0 (assuming the latest version of Babelfish is later than 1.3.0):\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport3 -analyze -babelfish-version 1.3.0`

Import all captured items into a PostgreSQL database table:\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport3 -pgimport "mybighost.anycompany.com,5432,bob,B!gbob72,mydb"`

Generate a cross-reference report named: `C:\...\BabelfishCompass\MyReport4\MyApp.xref.html`. (without `-reportfile`, the report file name would be something like `C:\...\BabelfishCompass\ MyReport4\report-MyReport4-2021-Sep-13-21.22.23.html`):\
`BabelfishCompass MyReport4 C:\temp\MyApp.sql -reportfile MyApp.xref -reportoption xref`

<br/>

# File handling

An assessment report is an HTML file located in the following directory:
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\BabelfishCompass\<report-name>`

A flat text version of the report is available in the same directory as the HTML file; this text version is named identically, but ends in `.txt` instead of `.html`.

If desired, the report file itself may be renamed.

The report directory contains multiple subdirectories as described below. Users of Babelfish Compass should not rename or edit the files in these subdirectories, as future invocations of Babelfish Compass for this report may no longer work correctly (or at all):
- `imported`: contains a copy of the original SQL/DDL input scripts. These are stored to allow re-running the analysis at a later time, for example for a newer version of Babelfish. In case the original input files were using a specific encoding, the files in the imported directory are in `UTF8` format. For each imported file, an HTML version is also located in this directory. When generating a cross-reference in the assessment report, hyperlinks are generated to the actual line in the original document where the SQL feature was found.
- `imported\sym`: files in this directory contain symbol table information, for internal use.
- `captured`: files in this directory contain items that were captured during analysis. These are SQL features and options, which are reflected in the assessment report. The files in this directory can be imported into a PostgreSQL database table using the `-pgimport` option.
- `log`: contains the session log file for each invocation of Babelfish Compass.
- `errorbatches`: this directory is created only when syntax errors were found in the imported SQL/DDL scripts. In this case, the input batches with the errors are saved in a file so that the user has access to this information. If desired, the user can rename or delete these files as they are not used as input for any further processing steps.

<br/>

# The BabelfishFeatures.cfg file

The compatibility assessment by the Babelfish Compass tool is driven by the file **BabelfishFeatures.cfg**, which is located in the Babelfish Compass installation directory. This file contains definitions of features that are (not) supported in a specific Babelfish version.

Users should not edit, modify or rename this file, since Babelfish Compass will detect this and terminate immediately.

For each Babelfish release that contains changes in functionality, a new version of the **BabelfishFeatures.cfg** will be created. When Babelfish Compass is already installed, the existing version of **BabelfishFeatures.cfg** can be replaced (overwritten) by a newer version of this file.

<br/>

# Security

The Babelfish Compass tool is a stand-alone, on-premises program which does not store any confidential or sensitive information: all information stored is derived from the SQL/DDL scripts which the user provided as input.

The Babelfish Compass tool operates offline and does not perform any network access (with the exception of the `-pgimport` option, see below).

The Babelfish Compass tool does not "phone home" and makes no network connections invisible to the user. For example, it does not perform a "check for updates": installing an update must be performed manually by the user.

The `-pgimport` option is the only function where network access takes place, by connecting to a PostgreSQL instance and loading captured items into a database table.

Technically, Babelfish Compass creates file `pg_import.bat` and `pg_import.psql` in the captured directory. The `pg_import.bat` file executes p`g_import.psql`, which runs a `CREATE TABLE` and a `COPY` statement in PostgreSQL. Babelfish Compass executes this function by spawning a subprocess to run `pg_import.bat`.

To make a connection to the PostgreSQL instance, the user must specify connection attributes on the Babelfish Compass command line, including the PostgreSQL username and password. These connection attributes are not written to any file, but are supplied as environment variables in the short-lived spawned subprocess. These environment variables are not accessible from the outside the spawned subprocess.
_Note that the connection attributes may be accessible through the command-line history in the cmd prompt session._

As for the uploaded captured items, it is assumed that the user owns the PostgreSQL instance and is responsible for granting access to the uploaded data.

<br/>

# Using Babelfish Compass in PostgreSQL Migrations

Users of SQL Server can use Babelfish Compass to analyze the SQL/DDL code for their current SQL Server-based applications for compatibility with Babelfish. The purpose of such analysis is to inform a Go/No Go decision about whether it makes sense -or not- to consider starting a migration project from SQL Server to Babelfish. For this purpose, Babelfish Compass produces an assessment report which lists -in great detail- all SQL features found in the SQL/DDL code, and whether or not these are supported by the latest version of Babelfish.

On a high level, the sequence of steps to be taken is as follows:
1. The application owner identifies the SQL Server databases required for the application that is considered for migration to Babelfish. The application owner is recommended to ensure there are no legal restrictions with respect to migrating the application in question.
2. Reverse-engineer the SQL Server database(s) in question with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This is done in the SSMS object explorer by right-clicking a database. Then select **Tasks** -> **Generate Scripts**, and follow the dialog (make sure to enable **triggers**, **collations**, **logins**, **owners** and **permissions** (these are disabled in SSMS by default), by clicking the **Advanced** button and turning on the respective options).
3. SSMS produces a DDL/SQL script as output. Use this script (one or more) as input for Babelfish Compass to generate an assessment report (see instructions and examples earlier in this User Guide).
4. Optionally, generate additional cross-reference reports to obtain additional details about the unsupported features.
5. Discuss the results of the Babelfish Compass assessment with the application owner and interpret the findings in the context of the application to be migrated. In these discussions, it may be possible to descope the migration by identifying outdated or redundant parts of the application which do not need to be migrated.
6. The owner of the application to be migrated needs to take a decision whether, given the assessment results that show the unsupported SQL features in the SQL/DDL code, it is opportune to start a migration project to Babelfish. If the current version of Babelfish is deemed to be insufficiently compatible with the application in question, it is recommended to re-run the analysis when future releases of Babelfish are available which will provide more functionality.
7. When proceeding, modify the SQL/DDL scripts to rewrite or remove the SQL/DDL statements that were reported as 'not supported' or requiring 'review'. Then execute the SQL/DDL script against Babelfish (with `sqlcmd`) to recreate the schema in Babelfish.
8. Finally, perform data migration, and reconfigure the client applications to connect to Babelfish.

Please keep the following in mind:
- Admittedly, the amount of detail in a Babelfish Compass assessment report can be large. When discussing the Babelfish Compass findings with the application owner, make sure to highlight the many aspects that are supported by Babelfish: experience has shown that when focusing primarily on the non-supported features, SQL Server users may easily end up with an unnecessary negative perception of Babelfish's capabilities.
- A Babelfish migration involves more than just the server-side SQL/DDL code, for example, interfaces with other system; ETL/ELT; SSIS/SSRS, replication, etc. These aspects may not be reflected in the server-side view provided by Babelfish Compass.

<br/>

# Troubleshooting

This section contains some troubleshooting tips. It is recommended to first read this User Guide in detail when encountering unexpected behavior.

- Syntax errors: while the SQL/DDL input scripts are reverse-engineered from existing applications and their contents are therefore assumed to contain syntactically valid SQL code, it is possible that the SQL code contains syntax errors, for example as a result of manual editing (one example: it is mandatory to terminate the `MERGE` statement with a semicolon, while such a terminator is optional for most other T-SQL statements).<br/><br/>
In case of a syntax error, this will be printed to `stdout`, and the offending batch will be logged in a file in the `errorbatches` subdirectory in the report directory. A batch containing syntax errors is not analyzed by Babelfish Compass.<br/><br/>
Remedy: correct any SQL syntax errors and re-run the script through the Babelfish Compass tool using the `-replace` flag.
- If syntax errors are printed which show garbage characters, it may be that the input file encoding is not correctly specified. The default encoding ,and all available encodings, are displayed with the `-encoding` help option.<br/><br/>
Remedy: specify the correct encoding with `-encoding <encoding>` on the command line.
- On Mac/Linux (currently in beta), it has been observed that UTF16-encoded input files are not always automatically recognized despite having the required BOM bits. This can lead to errors being reported like:\
`Line 2 contains only 0x00. Please verify input file encoding. Continuing, but errors may occur.`\
<br/>
Remedy: specify `-encoding UTF-16` on the command line.
